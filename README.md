## Component Overview

### `.vscode/`
Contains settings specific to Visual Studio Code, such as debugging configurations and workspace preferences.

### `bin/`
Includes scripts to initialize and start the application, commonly containing a `www` file to set up the server.

### `database/`
Houses database models and configuration files, defining the structure and relationships of data entities and managing database connections.

### `middlewares/`
Contains middleware functions that process requests before they reach the main route handlers. These can handle tasks such as authentication, logging, and request parsing.

### `routes/`
Defines the application's API endpoints and associates them with controller functions to handle incoming requests.

### `server/`
Manages server setup and configuration, including initializing the Express application, setting up middleware, and configuring ports.

### `services/`
Implements the core business logic, such as handling user authentication, managing chat sessions, and processing messages.

### `test/`
Contains test cases to ensure the application's components function as intended, potentially using frameworks like Mocha or Jest.

### `utils/`
Provides utility functions and helpers used across the application, promoting code reuse and modularity.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

## Usage

To start the application:

### **Development Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command uses Nodemon to automatically restart the server upon code changes.

### **Production Mode:**
```bash
npm start
```
This command starts the server without automatic restarts.

By default, the application will be accessible at:  
ðŸ“Œ `http://localhost:3000`
